# Next.js 3D Portfolio - Tutorial Project  

I'm following a tutorial to build a **fully responsive and interactive portfolio** using **Next.js, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS**. The project focuses on integrating **3D models, smooth animations, AI-generated images, and dynamic stats** to create a modern and engaging user experience. My goal is to apply these skills to future personal projects and improve my frontend development expertise.  

## What I'm Using  
- **Next.js** – Building performance-optimized React applications  
- **Three.js & react-three-fiber** – Creating and animating 3D models  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Writing clean, responsive styles efficiently  
- **EmailJS** – Handling email submissions in web apps  
- **react-hook-form** – Creating user-friendly interactive forms  
- **Sonner** – Implementing modern notification systems  
- **GitHub API** – Displaying dynamic GitHub stats on a webpage  

## TODO: 
- **Motion** – Add UI animations
